  description: Can programming plans represent the key skills in introductory programming? In this work, we applied learning curve analysis using plans as knowledge components and found that some plans are associated with discrete skills acquired by students.

- title: "Profiling Conversational Programmers at University: Insights into their Motivations and Goals from a Broad Sample of Non-Majors"
  image: icer2024-jina.png
  description: How prevalent are conversational programmers, and how do their attitudes and interests differ from end-user programmers? In this study, we found that conversational programmers are more common among non-majors than end-user programmers, but they face more challenges in their motivation for computing.
