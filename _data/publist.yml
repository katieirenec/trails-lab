- title: "PLAID: Supporting Computing Instructors to Identify Domain-Specific Programming Plans at Scale"
  image: chi2025.png
  description: How do instructors identify common patterns in a computing domain? Can we help them by automating information gathering with LLMs? In this work, we interviewed 10 computing educators to understand their challenges in programming plan identification, and designed PLAID for supporting them in information gathering and refinement tasks through design workshops. An user study with 12 participants showed that PLAID helps instructors to identify programming plans faster, with smaller workload, and with more satisfaction.

  description: Can programming plans represent the key skills in introductory programming? In this work, we applied learning curve analysis using plans as knowledge components and found that some plans are associated with discrete skills acquired by students.

- title: "Profiling Conversational Programmers at University: Insights into their Motivations and Goals from a Broad Sample of Non-Majors"
  image: icer2024-jina.png
  description: How prevalent are conversational programmers, and how do their attitudes and interests differ from end-user programmers? In this study, we found that conversational programmers are more common among non-majors than end-user programmers, but they face more challenges in their motivation for computing.
