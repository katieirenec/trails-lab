- q: Is the lab hiring new students?
  a: As Katie will be on maternity leave during the 2026 PhD student recruitment cycle, 
  and also due to the higher yield of PhD students at Illinois CS than expected due to other
  institutions decreasing their admission, Katie will likely minimize her admission of new PhD 
  students for the 2026 cycle. 
  #We are open to new PhD applicants, as well as undergrads who would like to 
  #  participate in a project. Now that the lab is a bit more established,
  #   we are considering Masters students as well.

     To apply for a graduate position, please complete the Illinois CS grad application, being sure to
     indicate your interest in the Computers and Education area, as well as in 
     working with Katie Cunningham. 
     Undergrads should email Katie, being sure to be very clear about their interests.
    <br>
     Katie usually waits until graduate student applications are submitted to evaluate all 
     applicants. You are welcome to email Katie about grad admissions, but your application will be the 
     most important way to show your interest.
